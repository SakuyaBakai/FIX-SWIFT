## **About Swift**
Swift is a multipurpose ROBLOX executor, created by 0xcoredumped. **sUNC: 97% | UNC: 96%**

**Official Website: https://getswift.xyz**\
**Official Discord: https://discord.gg/getswift**

## **Installation**

You **MUST** disable your anti-virus, otherwise required files may not be downloaded properly. See [Disable Anti-Virus](#disabling-anti-virus)

1. Join the [Swift Discord Server](https://discord.gg/getswift)
2. Download `swift-bootstrapper.exe` from #download-here
3. Once installed, double-click the bootstrapper file and wait for the files to copy.
4. All Set! Now you have Swift.exe installed. You will have to sign up.

### **Signing up**

1. Obtain a key from https://getswift.xyz/real/0/0/0/0. See [Loot-Labs Issues](#loot-labs-not-working) for troubleshooting.
2. Register with a **unique** username and password (make sure to remember the password!) and put your key in.
3. You now have access to the Swift Executor! Note: Swift keys only last for a day. You will have to get a new one whenever it expires.
4. (optional) In the discord server, run /linkdiscord to link your discord account to your swift account. This will help recovering your account.


### **Disabling Anti-Virus**
This assumes you have administrative privileges and do not have any other anti-virus software on your device besides Windows Defender.
1. Open **Windows Settings** 
2. Go to the **Privacy & Security** tab.
3. Go to **Windows Security**
4. Select **Virus & Threat Protection**
5. Under **Virus & Threat Protection Settings** click **Manage Settings**
6. Disable **Real-Time Protection**. You may need to input an admin password.
7. Scroll down and disable **Tamper Protection**. You may need to input an admin password.

Notes: 
- The bootstrapper does **not** require administrative privileges, so Standard Accounts can run it
- You will need to disable your Anti-Virus in order to install. Swift is completely safe to use. Anti-Virus scans show false-positives.
- For the decompiler, read the [**Script Developer Info**](#script-developer-info)

## **Bug Fixes**
### **The instance with the Selected PID doesn't exist**
This means that Swift cannot find the ROBLOX Executable.\
To fix this, click the ☁️ button at the bottom left of the Swift UI and select the current ROBLOX process.

### **Bloxstrap Issues**
Reinstall [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/releases/latest)


### **Screen Black when injected**
This is because of the C++ Drawing Library used by Swift.
1. Download blackscreenfix.bat [**here**](https://nullstate.net/blackscreenfix.bat)
2. Run `blackscreenfix.bat` normally. Do **not** run as Admin
3. Bloxstrap will be automatically installed. Follow the instructions to install it.
4. ROBLOX will not launch. Once you see a pop up on the `blackscreenfix.bat`, you can cancel Bloxstrap.
5. Launch ROBLOX with the Bloxstrap Launcher.

If this doesn't work, follow these instructions:
1. Search for "Roblox" in the start menu
2. Right Click & Open File Location.
3. Right Click on Roblox Player & Open File Location
4. Right Click on RobloxPlayerBeta -> Properties -> Compatibility
5. Check **Disable Fullscreen Optimizations** is enabled.

### **Injector.exe does not exist / Dll3.dll does not exist**

2. Delete all swift-related files (`bin`, `notbin`, `workspace`, `scripts`, `autoexec`, `swift-bootstrapper.exe`, `Swift.exe`)
3. Press Win+R and type `%localappdata%` and delete the Swift folder (if it exists)
4. Redownload the swift-bootstrapper.exe from #download-here in the main server.
5. Kill any background apps with Task Manager (edge, explorer, spotify) and then try inject again.

### **HTTP Error 403**
You must re-do the key system. Go to https://getswift.xyz/real/0/0/0/0

## **Known Issues**

### **Game Freezes on Teleport**
Currently being investigated

### **Constant Crashes**
Currently being investigated

## **Script Developer Info**
Swift documentation -> https://docs.getswift.xyz/api-reference

Swift does not have a built-in decompiler, so you will have to install the **lua-lifter.exe** file in #changelogs (Added in 0.3.9 / Dec 24 2024).

The following functions have not been found in the sUNC test.\
❌ WebSocket.connect\
❌ getconnections\
❌ getcallbackvalue
